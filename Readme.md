# Using SAT solvers

# Independent set
The Python code to find an independent set of size k using the z3 solver can be found in this folder.
# Assignment
Write Python code to solve the following problems using the z3 solver

## 3-coloring
Write Python code to solve the 3-coloring problem for any input graph. Use the code for IS as a guide

## Clique
Write Python code to solve the clique of size k problem for any input graph. Use the code for IS as a guide.
**Note**: you cannot solve for IS and use the complement solution. Do it directly by changing the SAT clauses

# Grading
If you solve the two problems (3-coloring and Clique) correctly you receive 90%  of the grade. 
You earn the remaining 10 if you add a graphical display to your solution:
1. User selects the open file containing the graph description (see graph1.txt) your app should display the graph
2. Solve the problem and display it, replacing the original graph.
